# Interim Report: Refactor Phase 1 – Migration to ChromaDB & Scalable Engineering
## 2.1 Data Preparation and Integrity

- **Data Loading:** The ingestion script (`scripts/ingest.py`) loads financial complaint data from CSV files in the `data/raw/` directory using pandas for efficient reading and initial inspection.
- **Handling Missing Values:** During ingestion, the script checks for missing values in critical fields (such as complaint text, date, and category). Rows with missing essential information are excluded to maintain data quality. For non-critical fields, missing values are imputed with default placeholders or flagged for review.
- **Formatting and Normalization:** All date fields are parsed and standardized to a consistent format. Text fields are cleaned by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and trimming whitespace. Numerical fields are normalized where appropriate to ensure consistency across records.
- **Data Integrity Checks:** The script removes duplicate entries based on unique complaint IDs and validates that all required columns are present. Any anomalies or schema mismatches are logged for further investigation.
- **Auditability:** Each step in the data preparation pipeline is logged, providing a clear audit trail for data provenance and reproducibility—critical for financial applications.

## Project: Intelligent Complaint Analysis: An AI-Powered RAG System for Financial Services
## 1. What Was Expected for This Phase
- Replace FAISS with a scalable, persistent vector database (ChromaDB)
- Containerize ChromaDB (optional, if Docker is available)
- Create a dedicated ingestion script for efficient, one-time data loading
- Update .gitignore to exclude large vector store files
- Prepare for interactive app development (Gradio)

## 2. What Was Done
- **Replaced FAISS with ChromaDB:**
  - Migrated from FAISS to ChromaDB (local persistent mode)
  - Updated all retrieval logic to use ChromaDB
- **Efficient Data Ingestion:**
  - Created `scripts/ingest.py` for one-time, batched ingestion
  - Added progress reporting and chunk limiting for resource management
- **.gitignore Updated:**
  - Now ignores all ChromaDB, vector store, and large binary index files
- **Colab/Cloud Ready:**
  - Pipeline can be run on Google Colab for faster embedding and ingestion
- **Folder Structure Refactored:**
  - Moved utility scripts to `scripts/` for clarity and professionalism
- **Documentation Updated:**
  - README.md now documents the new workflow and folder structure

## 3. What Was Not Done (and Why)
- **Containerized ChromaDB (Docker):**
  - Not completed due to local Docker issues and user preference for a no-Docker solution
- **Interactive Gradio App:**
  - Not yet implemented; scheduled for Phase 2
- **Deployment (Hugging Face Spaces):**
  - Not yet started; planned for Phase 4

## 4. Plan to Reschedule Pending Tasks
- **Phase 2:**
  - Build and launch the Gradio chat interface (`app.py`)
  - Ensure seamless integration with local ChromaDB
  - Add a simple run script for local use
- **Phase 3:**
  - Overhaul README.md for professional presentation
  - Add visual demo, architecture diagram, and clear run instructions
- **Phase 4:**
  - Deploy the app on Hugging Face Spaces
  - Add live demo link to README

## 5. Plan to Improve the Project
- Modularize code for easier maintenance and extension
- Add more robust error handling and logging
- Optimize ingestion and retrieval for large-scale data
- Enhance documentation and onboarding instructions
- Prepare for cloud deployment and public demo

## 6. Tasks Remaining
- Build and test the Gradio chat interface
- Finalize and document the local run workflow
- Create visual and architectural assets for README
- Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

## 7. Tasks Completed So Far
- Migrated to ChromaDB (local persistent mode)
- Created and tested ingestion script (`scripts/ingest.py`)
- Updated .gitignore and folder structure
- Updated documentation to reflect new workflow
